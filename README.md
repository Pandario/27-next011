The main idea was to work with next14 here with router and also with databases. Mostly everything here made from reusable components. All modal windows - technically just one with different {children}. All forms connected to real db. In main we have 3 blocks. Sort of book different camp-bungalow or boat, or just restaurant. Its same modal, but it takes different values, so we know for sure what client chosen.

We also have modal inside modal. Don't know if someone need it, but at least I know how to make it.

Also I have "broken page', not-found.js. Just to try in case if something is broken or person typed something with mistake.
